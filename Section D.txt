 As a mentor I would identify "dropout" factors such as lack of engagement in activities,
 lack of involvement in discussions or even lack of attendance.
 My intervention strategies would be to make mentoring sessions relevant.
 In doing so, I would allow students to make a connections to the content and
 therefore enhancing student engagement. 

 The lack of involvement in activities could be as a result to lack of comprehension. 
 As a mentor, I would have to avail myself to students for further consultation to ensure
 their own development. 

 Lack of attendance can prohibit comprehension of content. 
 It is important that I as the teacher make my expectations known and also create meaningful
 ways to have my students involved with the content which would help overcoming the barrier of attendance
